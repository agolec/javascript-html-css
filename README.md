# javascript-html-css

This project is meant to cover 1. fundamentals of HTML and CSS as it applies to Javascript,
and 2. comprehensively cover Javascript.

It is not to be comprehensive about every single aspect of HTML and CSS, but give enough information so that I can focus on everything Javascript has to provide to enhance HTML and CSS.

I will be covering HTML and CSS extensively in another repository.

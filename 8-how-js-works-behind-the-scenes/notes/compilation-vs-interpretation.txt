            The computer's CPU only knows about 0s and 1s.

    The source code of our program must be converted into machine code.

    This conversion can be done with either Compilation, or Interpretation.


    Compilation Steps:
    
        Source Code ----- Step 1 (Compilation) ------> Portable File: Machine Code ---- Step 2: Execution ------> Program Running

        With compilation, code is compiled all in one shot into machine code (usually a binary file) that can be executed by the computer.

        The execution can happen at any time in the future.

    Interpretation Steps:

        Source Code ------- Step 1: Execute the code line by line ------> Program Running

        With Interpretation, the interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line live.


    JS used to be a purely interpreted language. Now in the current era, low performance isn't acceptable, so Javascript does just-in-time compilation, 
    along with interpretation.

    It compiles what is necessary bare minimum to begin executing code, and from then on it inteprets.
